# Lifestyle-factors-ontology (LSFO)
Lifestyle-factors ontology (LSFO), is a multilevel hierarchical structure that begins with main lifestyle categories at the top level and extends to specific subcategories and low-level concepts. 

### Lifestyle Categories

Within the context of lifestyle, we have identified several categories that can collectively describe all LSFs, namely:

1. **Nutrition**: A category that covers different branches such as dietary habits, food groups, food processing and preparation, macronutrients, and micronutrients, among others.
2. **Socioeconomic factors**: Includes social and economic conditions such as income, wealth, education, and socioeconomic status.
3. **Environmental exposures**: Includes exposure to various environmental factors, such as air pollution, water quality, and workplace hazards, that can impact an individualâ€™s health.
4. **Substance use**: Covers concepts such as smoking, as well as illicit drug use.
5. **Physical activities**: Includes regular exercise and physically demanding activities like leisure time, occupational, and household physical activities.
6. **Non-physical leisure time activities**: Any activity an individual might engage in during their free time that is not a physical activity.
7. **Beauty and cleaning**: Covers activities related to hygiene, use of cosmetic and cleaning products as well as invasive procedures that people undergo to improve their appearance, such as cosmetic surgery.
8. **Sleep**: Covers sleep quality, stages, and habits.
9. **Mental health practices**: Includes the behaviors and habits related to maintaining good mental health and emotional well-being such as meditation, and psychotherapy.
